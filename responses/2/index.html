		<p>Another lady is a waitress at Denny's and works very hard.  She aspires to be a nurse, but had just about given up because it was so hard to come to night classes after working as a waitress all day. After she read your story, she was so inspired!  She told the class that "if a lady that raised nine children, written eight books, and graduated from college, could endure to get an education, she could too".  All because she read your story!</p>
