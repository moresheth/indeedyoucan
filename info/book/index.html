	<p>Age was only an illusionary figure in Elleta Nolte&rsquo;s life, not to be taken seriously. She enrolled at age 71 as a freshman at a prestigious university from which six of her nine children graduated. At age 89, she earned a Degree in General Studies and graduated with her granddaughter Rebecca.</p>

	<p>Elleta is a writer of regional history, but this, her eighth book, is a departure from that norm, for at her graduation, many people of all ages said to her, &ldquo;You need to tell people what you did and what they can do, that age can have a positive effect on their lives.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Her book, Indeed You Can, is that telling, as she relates many of the humorous and profound details of her learning experience: &ldquo;I greeted each day on campus as a new beginning&mdash;the best of the rest of my life. I felt forty of my years melt away when I set foot amid the rushing, bustling aura of the campus filled with the leaders of tomorrow. I wasn&rsquo;t a finished product; in my heart I was young again, anxious to test new ground and gain new knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Elleta&rsquo;s offbeat sense of humor welcomed the campus comments: from her professor in her electronic media class who said, &ldquo;I never knew I&rsquo;d have a student older than radio,&rdquo; to the students who asked, &ldquo;Why would you want to do that... What are you going to be when you grow up?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Elleta&rsquo;s words are for all ages in all roles of life. May they inspire you to use the strength and talents that are uniquely yours to enter a world of change in your routine, to not place your mind on hold, but place it on roam to set new goals and follow new paths, to add a little daring to your life, a few what ifs&#133; what&nbsp;if&nbsp;I&#133;</p>

	<p>Indeed you can.</p>
